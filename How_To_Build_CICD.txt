CI/CD pipeline workflow in github actions- whenever there is a new git push hanppens to the git repo - the pipline gets triggered.
The github actions flow should rebuild the docker image and push the final version into aws EC2 machine and run the container with new image and should launch the application.

1. You push code to GitHub - 
   mkdir reponame
   cd reponame
   git init
   git add .
   git remote 
   git commit -m
   git push
   ↓
2. GitHub Actions detects push to main branch
   ↓
3. JOB 1: build-and-push
   - Checkout code from repo
   - Set up Docker Buildx
   - Login to Docker Hub
   - Create image tags
   - Build Docker image from Dockerfile
   - Push image to Docker Hub
   ↓
4. JOB 2: deploy (only if job 1 succeeds)
   - SSH into EC2
   - Login to Docker Hub
   - Pull latest image
   - Stop old container
   - Remove old container
   - Run new container on port 80
   - Clean up old images
   - Logout from Docker Hub
   ↓
5. Your app is now live at http://ec2 publicIP


```Complete Step-by-Step Guide
Phase 1: Create Sample Application - package.json, server.js, Dockerfile 
Phase 2: Push to GitHub , ensure the git repo is created
phase 3: create github actions workflow - can be created in local and be pushed to GitHub , basiclaly wcicd.yml file
Phase 4: Configure Secrets in the GitHub settings for the repo - DockerHub credentails, EC2 ip, username and SSH private key .pem file
Phase 5: Ensure EC2 instance is running, docker is installed
Phase 6: Trigger the workflow by pushing something from local git to github repo - The pipleine will run Build +Deploy job
Phase 7: Test the pipline- see if the ec2 public ip runs the application and its changes. or curl ip in terminal

NOTE for Secrets in GitHub:
DOCKERHUB_USERNAME: Your Docker Hub username
DOCKERHUB_TOKEN: Token from step 1
EC2_HOST: Your EC2 public IP (e.g., 54.123.45.67)
EC2_USERNAME: Usually ubuntu or ec2-user
EC2_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: Your EC2 private key content
